# Blood Bowl website v2 Front end

This project is the front end part of a league management tool for the board game Blood Bowl.

This is not a project I actively work on, but I come back regulary on it to add small parts.

The final goal is to have a tool where users can connect, manage and create team, sign up to some tournaments and follow the evolution of those tournaments.
